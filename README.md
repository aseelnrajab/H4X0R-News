# H4X0R News App

 H4X0R News App, is an hacker news reader app.
 I used the hacker news API to get hold of the latest articles that are trending on Hacker News Website.
 
 ## What I learned and applied 

1. SwiftUI Lists and Identifiable protocol.
2. Navigation View.
3. Advanced State Managment using the Observer Design pattern.
4. UIKit and learned how to incorporate it into SwiftUI by using WebKit to display web pages in the app.
